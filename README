                    gnunet-fuse - FUSE filesystem for GNUnet

Summary
=======
You need the URI of a file with the mime-type of application/gnunet-directory.
You can either publish a directory with gnunet-insert or do a search for the
mime-type. To mount the URI use the following command.

$ echo gnunet://ecrs/chk/XXXX/YYYY.NNNN > uri_file
$ gnunet-fs uri_file /mnt

Where gnunet://ecrs/chk/XXXX/YYYY.NNNN is the URI and /mnt is the mount point.

Usage
=====
gnunet-fuse [OPTIONS] <URI FILE> <PATH>
Arguments mandatory for long options are also mandatory for short options.
  -h, --help                 print this help
  -c, --config=FILENAME      use configuration file FILENAME
  -L, --log=LOGLEVEL         configure logging to use LOGLEVEL
  -l, --logfile=FILE         set logfile name
  -a, --anonymity=LEVEL      set the desired LEVEL of sender-anonymity
  -p, --priority=LEVEL       set the desired LEVEL of priority
  -u, --uri-files            Make .uri files visible
  -x, --Xfuse                Escape fuse option

Example use of -x option:
$ gnunet-fs -x-o -xfsname=GNUnet <URI> <path>
Mounts <URI> at <path> and passes "-o fsname=GNUnet" as fuse options.

Special Files
=============
Each directory contains the following special files. These files are read-only
and aren't actually part of the directory, they are generated on-the-fly by
gnunet-fs.

 .uri        - contains the URI of the directory
 .uri.<file> - contains the URI of the file named <file> in the directory
