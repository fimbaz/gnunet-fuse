Description: secure, trust-based peer-to-peer framework (fuse filesystem client)
 GNUnet is a peer-to-peer framework which focuses on providing security. All
 link-to-link messages in the network are confidential and authenticated. The
 framework provides a transport abstraction layer and can currently encapsulate
 the peer-to-peer traffic in UDP, TCP, or SMTP messages.
 .
 This package contains the fuse filesystem client. In order use GNUnet, you also
 need gnunet-server either on your server or on your local machine.
